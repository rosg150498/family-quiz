## Website Design Choices

### Colours

I have come to the conclusion that the best way to attract the interest of the greatest number of people is to devise a family trivia game that people of all ages would enjoy participating in.
This single page website will use a traditional blue as its background colour since blue is generally associated with sentiments of serenity, confidence, and unity. It also portrays a sense of quiet and tranquilly, which is why this website uses it. Because it is more aesthetically pleasing for users, I have chosen to make the primary backdrop a blue colour with the hex code #0F4C81, and I will use the colour #FFFFFF for the dominant body text colour.

Given the good contrast that #E6E6E6 offers, the name field text area box will use this colour shade and questions for the family quiz will be comprised of this shade as well. I will pick #FFFFFFF as the colour for the answers to the quiz since it contrasts nicely with both #0B600B, which indicates that the user provided the proper answer, and #AD0401, which indicates that the user provided an incorrect response.


### Fonts

I have made the decision to choose Open Sans as my primary font since it is an uncluttered, sophisticated, legible, and contemporary typeface that possesses intelligible features and is straightforward with dyslexia characteristics. This specific font contains features that are appropriate for use in a family setting and is easy to read when it comes to the content of online quizzes. The headings of the page will be set in Lato as it contrasts with Open Sans and is also a friendly sans-serif font that is very readable on different screen sizes 

### Icons

I aim to utilise a symbolic symbol portraying a happy family to make the website feel more friendly and cosy. Icons may help users maintain attention by providing a visual representation of information and balancing text and graphics. Additional symbols, such as those depicting questions, answers, and scores, will also be displayed in other portions of the single page website.

### Wireframes 

I have included wireframes of the sections that I intend to include in the family quiz application's single page design. Each wireframe is a proposed design of what I expect the overall look and feel to be, and each is a portion of the single page site.

### Media Queries / Responsive Design

## Project Features

### Current Features

#### Main Menu Page

This is my main menu page for the Family quiz single page website which is fully responsive across mobile screen devices max-width 320px and 470px. Users can navigate to any section of the quiz by clicking on one of the provided button and which I have set the cursor to pointer to allow users to become aware that they are navigating over that selected button link and so can add a welcoming feel. I have included an icon which I retrieved from the flat icon website to display an effective and informative representation of a rewarding experience with family members which can allow users to feel comfortable anywhere where they are located. The main menu consists of a enter name label with input box, submit name button along with a button for users to navigate to the quiz game.

Users must enter validate information and must not be blank before playing the quiz game. Users can gain incredible experience by providing a family name in the input field. If the user clicks the submit name button without entering a family name a pop up box will be displayed and users will be informed that they need to enter a name to proceed

<hr>


The family quiz section is similiar to the main menu section in terms of consistency. I felt it was appropriate to add an additional icon to portray an eager and determination to succeed in the enjoyable and packful theme of questions.

The inputted family name is display inside an asthetically appealing subtle banner to allow users to easily keep track that the name is accurate and spelt correctly. Within this banner score is also included which the default score is set as 0. Users can keep track of their score at any time throughout the duration of the quiz and can feel at ease as they progress with the quite challenging questions.

The questions and answers can be easily identified and users can select an answer by clicking one of the radio buttons which is very-friendly as they allow users to identify the answer they have selected and can change any choice with a click of a button. Once a user is satisfied with their selected answer they can submit the answer by clicking on the provided submit answer button and will then progress to the next stage of the quiz.
